Bloggart27 is a blog application for Google App Engine. It runs on the  python27 runtime and is based off bloggart, currently being developed as a demonstration app for <a href="http://blog.notdot.net/2009/10/Writing-a-blog-system-on-App-Engine">a series of blog posts</a>, but is intended to be a useful and versatile blogging system for App Engine by the time it's done.
